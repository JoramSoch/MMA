### Voxel-wise multi-modal analyses for MRI data using SPM

This code allows to perform [SPM-style](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) GLM analyses across multiple modalities (e.g. structural MRI, functional MRI and resting-state fMRI), using one of these modalities as the dependent variable and other modalities as voxel-wise covariates, possibly influencing the variable of interest. Model parameters and results are stored in the [SPM.mat](https://github.com/spm/spm12/blob/master/spm_spm.m#L157-L217) format, such that analysis outcomes can be viewed using SPM's results interrogation.
